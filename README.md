# BlackJack
Just a simple game of Black Jack for learning purpose.

# Notes
As one of the games used to learn how to code in Python,
I had a lot of fun with this one. I like to create more of
a GUI even though it is just a console or text based game.

Kinda has the feel of an early 90's dos game.

The key points I picked up from this project:

• Creating and using classes with methods.
• Passing arguments to functions and methods.
• Organizing code to be more easily read.
• Pep8 guidelines
• Plan out the game before coding.
