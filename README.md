# BlackJack
Just a simple game of Black Jack for learning purpose.

# Notes
As one of the games used to learn to code in Python,
I had a lot of fun with this one. I like to create more of
a GUI even though it is just a console or text based game.

Kind of feels like an early 90's MS-DOS game.

The key points I picked up from this project:

• Creating and using classes with methods. 

• Passing arguments to functions and methods.

• Organizing code to be more easily read.

• Pep8 guidelines

• Plan out the game before coding.
